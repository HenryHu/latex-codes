\subsection{Previous Work}
In subsections there is 1 blank line before the section 
heading and one afterwards.  Heading text is 11 point 
bold font.  Paragraphs are indented one pica.  There is 
no blank line between paragraphs.
Throughout I may cite references of the form 
\cite{key:foo} or \cite{foo:baz}, and LaTeX will keep 
track of numbering.  The numbers are based on the order 
you place them in the bibliography, not the order they 
appear in the text.  They should (I believe) be in 
alphabetical order.  LaTex will put square brackets about 
the number within the text of your paper.  For those of 
you new to the bibliography package, you may have to run 
the latex process twice to allow all references to be 
resolved. You will get a warning about a missing .aux 
file.  Just rerun latex and it will be ok.
