DRAFT: Parallelism of software programs is influenced by many factors 
including code quality, underlying infrastructure, I/O bandwidth, and,
maybe VMM. In this report, we tend to evaluate the influence of VMM on 
modern multi-threaded programs and diagnose potential issues that limit 
the parallelism on virtual machines.
