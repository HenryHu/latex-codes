%IEEE allows italicized abstract
{\em
This is the abstract of my paper.  It must fit within the 
size allowed, which is about 3 inches, including section 
title, which is 11 point bold font.  If you don't want 
the text in italics, simply remove the 'em' command and 
the curly braces which bound the abstract text.  If you 
have em commands within an italicized abstract, the text 
will come out as normal (non-italicized) text.
